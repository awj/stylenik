== Stylenik: A graphical editor for mapnik files ==

Load and edit mapnik style files through an online interface, with
automatic layer ordering, special support for common style elements
(e.g. highway casing), scale-dependent styles, a color picker, ... etc.

A long term goal is to provide near-realtime previews of styles from a
server capable of handling multiple simultaneous projects.
